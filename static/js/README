GIT web interface (gitweb) - JavaScript
=======================================

This directory holds JavaScript code used by gitweb (GIT web interface).
Scripts from there would be concatenated together in the order specified
by gitweb/Makefile into gitweb/static/gitweb.js, during building of
gitweb/gitweb.cgi (during gitweb building).  The resulting file (or its
minification) would then be installed / deployed together with gitweb.

Scripts in 'lib/' subdirectory compose generic JavaScript library,
providing features required by gitweb but in no way limited to gitweb
only.  In the future those scripts could be replaced by some JavaScript
library / framework, like e.g. jQuery, YUI, Prototype, MooTools, Dojo,
ExtJS, Script.aculo.us or SproutCore.

All scripts that manipulate gitweb output should be put outside 'lib/',
directly in this directory ('gitweb/static/js/').  Those scripts would
have to be rewritten if gitweb moves to using some JavaScript library.

See also comments in gitweb/Makefile.
